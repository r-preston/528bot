## Todo

1. Make the "~river <river>" search better. Currently you can only search by rivers not by section. e.g. "dart" will work and return all section but "upper dart" returns nothing. A large part of this because rain chasers's search functionality is not good and I'm just using their API.
2. Improve discord status so the bot can be doing something other than "playing" on a a river. (This requires discord to stop being lazy and add the feature)
3. Implement circling games?

## How to test

You will need a server or channel on the warwick canoe server to test it on. (Consider the 528test channel)

You will also need to contact me for the authentication token.

First clone the repo then create a .env file with two variables `FIVE_CHANNEL` and `VALID_CHANNELS`.

`FIVE_CHANNEL` should contain a single chanel. This will be the channel that the 528ing is done on. (528 currently doesn't work).

`VALID_CHANNELS` should contain a series of channel names seperated by commas. This is list of channels that the bot will send messages to.

An example .env file would look like: 

```
FIVE_CHANNEL=five2eightme
VALID_CHANNELS=five2eightme,otherstuff,anotherchannel
```

To start the bot run `$npm run dev`. The bot will restart when it detects a file has been changed.
